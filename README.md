### App in Flask  with (CNN)  from the fast.ai  MOOC (dogs vs. cats)

I upload the image which is then fed through a pretrained CNN  and the predictions are presented. Works for 2 classes( My wife vs. my doughter photos) but easy to extend to arbitrary number of classes or retrained on different set of photos given a pre-trained model. 

run:
python server.py 

Parabens!
