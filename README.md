### App in Flask  with (CNN)  from the fast.ai  MOOC (dogs vs. cats)

I upload the image then  image is fed through a precomputed CNN  and the predictions are returned on the next page. Works for 2 classes( My wife or my doughter photos) but easy to extend to arbitrary number of classes or retrained on different set of photos given a pre-trained model. 

run:
python server.py 

Parabens!
